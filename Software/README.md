# Software Used for LiDAR visualization

Please note that the software is created by the device's manufacturer.

Code is modified to compile on my machine specifically.

The code is working on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine with ROS Melodic. Any other variation may be malfunctioning.

For LiDAR visualization on a Windows Machine please refer to the manufacturer's stock software located in the Windows Visualization folder.
