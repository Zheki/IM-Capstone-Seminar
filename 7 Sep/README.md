My goal is to create an interactive virtual or augmented reality environment, by using
relatively new technologies which have applications in surveillance. Although my idea is slightly vague, this only gives me more liberty to expand
the project whenever that is needed. The largest challenge that I expect to face is the difficulty of
designing and creating a physical prototype, however, I truly look forward to those challenges
because I am certain that it will be an enormous learning experience, that will truly strengthen
my foundation for a practical career in the field of IM after graduation.
