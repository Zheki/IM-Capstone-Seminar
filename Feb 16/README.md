# Weekly report February 16 2022

Throughout the past week I was finalizing the item list of what needs to be bought for my capstone project. Some of the things such as the scanner were already ordered. 
Unfortunately due to the global chip shortage there is a global unavailability of Raspberry Pi microcomputers. I discussed this issue with my professors and advisors and the conclusion was to rent a Raspberry Pi from the IM lab. However, since initially I was planning for the microcomputer to be permanently attached to the main contraption, I need to come up with some designs that would allow me to attach it temporarly, since this is a part that has to be returned at the end of the semester. Because of this, I decided that if I make holders for the microcomputer, I should also make holders for the scanner and make it removable. Since the part has not arrived yet, I am using information from a schematic to build my 3D model.
